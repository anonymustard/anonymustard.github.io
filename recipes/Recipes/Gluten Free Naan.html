				Directions
			</h3><div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>1. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Have ready a dinner plate on which to place the baked naan, plus a clean kitchen towel to cover them.</p><p>2. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, xanthan gum, salt, sugar, baking powder, and yeast.</p><p>3. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the water, yogurt, olive oil, and green onions or garlic.</p><p>4. Add the flour mixture to the water mixture and place the bowl into the stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Beat on low speed to combine, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 4 minutes. Use an oiled spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl, if necessary.</p><p>5. Turn out the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm draft-free place for at least 2 hours. The dough should puff up and be full of bubbles.</p><p>6. Dust a work surface with tapioca flour and turn out the dough onto it. Using your hands, gently shape the dough into a dome. Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, cur the dough into three equal wedges. Then cut each of the wedges in half, giving you six smaller wedges. Gently shape each wedge into a ball using floured hands and place them on a corner of the work surface.</p><p>7. Dust the work surface with tapioca flour again and place one ball of dough onto it. Sprinkle a little tapioca flour on top of the ball and, using the palm of your hand, press the ball into a disk. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into an oblong shape that is roughly 7 inches long by 5 inches wide and no thicker than 1/8 inch. The key to getting the naan to puff up and bubble is for the dough to be thin. Transfer the rolled dough to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining balls of dough.</p><p>8. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat until it is very hot but not smoking. Make sure you have a lid that is wide enough to fit the skillet.</p><p>9. Place a rolled piece of dough in the pan, taking care not to tear it. Cook until the dough is puffed up with bubbles, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the dough with a metal spatula, cover the pan with the lid, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. One side will probably have brown marks where the bubbles cooked; the other side will not have much browning. Watch the naan carefully so that they do not burn.</p><p>10. Transfer the naan to the dinner plate. Use a pastry brush to brush it lightly with some of the melted butter and cover it with the kitchen towel. Repeat with the rest of the rolled dough, placing each cooked naan on top of the one cooked before it and covering them with the kitchen towel. This serves to steam the naan lightly and keep them supple. (If the dough starts to stick to the pan when cooking, lightly brush the pan with a high-heat-tolerant vegetable oil like rice bran oil and continue cooking.) Naan is best eaten the day it is made.</p><p></p><p>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or layered with wax paper in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
