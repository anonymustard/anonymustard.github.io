				<p>1. 8 days before serving, combine salt, saltpeter (or pink salt), and brown sugar in a small bowl and whisk until homogenous. Rub evenly over every surface of brisket. Combine peppercorns, mustard, coriander, allspice, cloves, ginger, and bay leaves and sprinkle evenly over both sides of beef, pressing spices gently into the meat until they stick. Seal the beef in a vacuum sealed bag or a zipper-lock bag with all of the air pressed out of it. Place in coldest part of refrigerator and let rest for 7 days, flipping once a day.</p><p></p><p>2. To Cook in a Sous-Vide Cooker: The day before serving, remove the beef from the bag and carefully rinse off all spices under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels.

To Cook in a Dutch Oven: The day before serving, remove the beef from the bag and carefully rinse off all spices under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Preheat oven to 200°F.

Let rest at least overnight, and up to 3 days.</p><p></p><p>5. The day of: transfer cooking liquid to a large saucepan or Dutch oven along with carrots, potatoes, and cabbage.

				Notes
			</h3><div itemprop="notes">
				<p>2017-01-01: Tried corning 5 pounds of flat cut beef brisket. It came out good. The flat cut has a lot of fat. I should have trimmed the brisket before corning it. Instead, after cooking, I had to cut off most of the exterior fat. I also cooked a 2.5 lb point cut corned beef brisket from the store in the same water bath as the larger brisket. The point cut is much easier to trim and slice. This recipe has too much cabbage.</p>
